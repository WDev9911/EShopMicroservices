# EShopMicroServices

**EShopMicroServices** is a sample e-commerce system built with a modern **Microservices Architecture**, leveraging several clean and scalable software design principles and technologies.

## 🔧 Technologies & Architectural Patterns

- 🧱 **Microservices Architecture** – the system is split into loosely coupled services
- 🧼 **Clean Architecture** – maintainable and testable project structure
- 🧭 **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** – focus on the core domain and business logic
- 🎯 **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** – separate read and write operations
- 📦 **Vertical Slice Architecture** – organize features vertically rather than in layers
- 🐳 **Docker & Docker Compose** – containerized service deployment
- 🌐 **Docker Network** – internal communication between services via virtual networks
- 📮 **RabbitMQ** – asynchronous communication via message queues
- ⚙️ **ASP.NET Web API (.NET 8)** – build RESTful services
